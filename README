BAYES-X is a Bayesian inference tool for the analysis of X-ray observations of galaxy clusters. 
For more details please see the BAYES-X paper (arXiv:1310.1885). If you use BAYES-X, please cite the 
following papers in your publications:

BAYES-X Paper: arXiv:1310.1885
MultiNest Papers: arXiv:0704.3704, arXiv:0809.3437 & arXiv:1306.2144


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


I. LICENCE


BAYES-X uses MultiNest as the Bayesian inference engine, therefore users are required to agree to the
MultiNest licence (given in file called LICENCE in the multinest folder) before using BAYES-X.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


II. COMPILING BAYES-X


Please edit the Makefile in the main directory according to your compilers & library locations. Do 
'make all' to compile the code. On successful compilation an executable called 'BayesX' will be created
in the bin folder.


Required Libraries:
BAYES-X requires cfitsio, lapack & MultiNest libraries. MultiNest source code is provided in the folder 
called multinest. Default Makefile should automatically create MultiNest library in the lib folder.

To install dependencies on a Debian based system: sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev libcfitsio-dev


MPI Support:
The code is MPI compatible. In order to disable the MPI parallelization, remove -DMPI compilation flag.


gfortran compiler:
You might need to use the following flag while compiling the code with gfortran compiler to remove the
restriction imposed by gfortran on line length.
-ffree-line-length-none


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


III. RUNNING BAYES-X


BAYES-X can be run as follows:

./bin/BayesX [input-file]

in the serial mode, or:

mpirun -np [n] ./bin/BayesX [input-file]

in parallel mode. Here n is the number of cores & input-file is a text file with input parameters (read 
the following section). Please see infile64by64by32.inp or infileA262_256by256by433.inp for an example input file.

Datafile referred to in infile64by64by32.inp and infileA262_256by256by433.inp are provided in the data folder. User can use run BayesX with
both input files  to see an example of how it works.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------


IV. INPUT PARAMETERS


In order to run BAYES-X, the user must provide an input file (see e.g. infile64by64by32.inp). This file 
contains pairs of tags & parameter values where tags identify the inputs & start with the character '#'.
Parameter values corresponding to a given tag are specified in the following line. Details of these tags
is as follows:

#cluster_model:  Type of the clust model (with cluster_model =1, 2 or 3 for NFW, Einasto or polytropic profiles respectively). The polytropic model is based on Ghirardini2019 [A&A 627, A19 (2019)]

Description of different output files is as follows. Please refer to MultiNest README file (provided 
in the multinest folder) for more details.


[root].txt
Compatable with getdist, this file has 2+nPar columns. Columns have sample probability, -2*loglike,
parameter values. Sample probability is the sample prior mass multiplied by its likelihood & normalized 
by the evidence.


[root]post_separate.dat
This file is only created if multimodal is set to T & contains posterior samples separated by 2 blank lines. 
Format is the same as [root].txt file.


[root]stats.dat
Contains the global log-evidence, its error & local log-evidence with error & parameter means & standard
deviations as well as the  best fit & MAP parameters of each of the mode found with local log-evidence.


[root]post_equal_weights.dat
Contains the equally weighted posterior samples. Columns have parameter values followed by loglike value.


[root]summary.txt
There are nmode+1 (nmode = number of modes) rows in this file. First row has the statistics for the global 
posterior. After the first line there is one row per mode with nPar*4+2 values in each line in this file. 
Each row has the following values in its column mean parameter values, standard deviations of the parameters, 
bestfit (maxlike) parameter values, MAP (maximum-a-posteriori) parameter values, local log-evidence, maximum 
loglike value. If IS = T (i.e. INS being used), firs row has an additional value right at the end, INS 
log-evidence estimate.




Visualization of Output:

[root].txt file created by MultiNest is compatible with the format required by getdist package which is 
part of CosmoMC package. Refer to the following website in order to download or get more information about
getdist:

Johannes Buchner's PyMultiNest can also be used on existing MultiNest output to plot & visualize results.
